This is such a neat game and it's great to see warhammer getting some love in VR. However, this game also shows it's age. It got into the VR space fairly early on and you can feel that on everything from the shooting mechanics to just walking around. It all feels like it could fall apart at any moment. This combined with some very unbalanced areas will cause some huge frustration for a lot of people. Nothing like having two terminators spawn on the other side of a room with minimal cover so they can one shot you.
