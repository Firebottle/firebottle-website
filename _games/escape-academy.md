It's okay. The puzzles are pretty fun and creative, though none of it was super challenging. It also comes with a story that is extremely shallow and didn't really need to exist. The thing that bothered me most was that even in online co-op the game is splitscreen. This means you don't actually need to communicate to solve puzzles. You just tell your partner to look at the screen. This removes one of the more fun elements of these kinds of games.
