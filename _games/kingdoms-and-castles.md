A fun little city builder that has actual enemies that will attack and other factions to deal with. It's hard to find a game that is primarily focused on the city building yet still has these other options without it becoming a full on RTS. I also love that one of the main focuses of this game is building your city inside of defensive walls. It presents some unique challenges where you can't expand too fast or you'll be unable to defend properly. Overall, a pretty good game.
