Trombone Champ is a rare kind of music game that is difficult and challenging, but silly enough to keep me going. The sense of humor in this game is pretty great. I will warn you though, it's very easy to get hand cramps while playing this game. But it just might be addicting enough to overcome that and keep playing.
