I first played this back in 2019 for around 6 hours solo. I thought it was a good game back then, but I recently picked it up and played through it again with a friend. I have to say the co-op experience was much better for me. It's less demanding as you can review your co-op partner, but you still get to see all of the abilities, characters, and story. I'd definitely recommend playing co-op.
