This is an incredible game. Immortal Empires, though pricy, is exactly what I wanted. A combination of all of the warhammer factions since the first game in the series. This is exactly what I want to see out of warhammer games. Each faction having it's own unique mechanics means that you can play the game a dozen times and still see new things. Definitely recommended and pretty darn close to perfect.
