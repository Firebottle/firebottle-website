It's exactly what you'd expect from Fatshark as far as the gameplay goes. The game is sort of buggy, has crashes, and lacks much depth. However, as a 40k fan I have to give it props for the environment, atmosphere, and sound design. I have to admit, for release my score is probably a bit high but I am very bias towards 40k games.
