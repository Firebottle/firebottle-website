Good, but currently broken. Will have to update review later.

Okay, updating my review after playing this for many hours. The game pretty much remained broken, but also I got more exposed to how terrible it is to be in the open world. It can sometimes take hours to get somewhere, only to be stabbed in the back immediately by someone. I come from Ultima so I'm fairly used to being murdered and having my stuff stolen. But in Ultima it would only take a few minutes, maybe 15 minutes max, to get to where you're going. So when you died it wasn't much of a big deal.

The problem with mortal is that not only do you lose your gear, which you'll need to craft again after gathering resources (because the auction house is broken), but you also will need to run 30 minutes out on foot and tame a new horse. 

I really appreciate what this game is trying to do, but I think there are a lot of quality of life things that are missing here. I think this game will have a small dedicated community that may stick with it over time. But it could have been so much more.
