Again, the sniper elite games get much better with each version. Sniper Elite 5 is quite a bit better than 4, with it's massive levels and great improvements on stealth and weapons customization. However, the ending leaves a LOT to be desired. The game just sort of cuts off with a 10-15 second mission that makes it seem like they ran out of time.
