This might be up there at the top of my VR list. This game is just a super well done board game, but with so much D&D flavor that it's incredible. Everything from the way you choose the campaign to painting miniatures just adds a little bit extra to an already neat game. The board game itself is tough but fair and each of the classes brings cool new mechanics to the game.
