A great puzzle game that is extremely difficult for me. The tetris puzzles just don't click, but there are a ton of them. I wish there was more variety in the puzzles, as most everything is based off the same concept. I just feel like maybe I don't have the patience for this type of game, plus it is relatively hard to stream and keep interesting.
