Like vampire survivors, except with mechs. I like this one quite a bit because you have several different equipment slots on your mech in which you can build your own loadout. So if you want multiple machine guns, put one on each arm and one on each shoulder, etc... I have to say though, the difficulty is pretty tough if you don't get the perfect kit.
