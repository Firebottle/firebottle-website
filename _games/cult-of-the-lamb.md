This game really does seem like it'd be perfect for me. I love the cute look mixed with the cult theme. I love the evil animal crossing vibes it gives. It really is a neat concept that unfortunately is held back by a lot of different issues.

For starters, this game released extremely buggy and after a month, continues to be buggy. Issues like core buildings disappearing, monsters being invisible but still able to kill you, monsters just refusing to come up out of the ground to attack, and many more. All of this results in a someone frustrating experience that will have you restarting the game every 30 minutes while crossing your fingers and hope you don't get softlocked or lose progress.

Also, this game has one of the most frustrating and poorly planned final boss fights of any game I've played in a while. All of the other bosses in the game were easy to normal difficulty for me, but the final boss is a frustrating 4 phase fight full of randomness. The boss fight starts with it giving you a select for three random weapons and spells, which can be anything from basic to the best. This results in you just running the fight over and over in hopes of actually getting a combination that will allow you a chance at winning (a good sword or dagger + hounds spell). 

Once you've actually got a decent combination, you're thrown into the four phase fight which features primarily bullet hell bosses. The final phase especially threw so many bullets at me that the game itself couldn't handle it. I had to power through the lag and hope that I randomly rolled over some health so I wouldn't die.

I still recommend people check out the game, but only when it is on sale and after many bug fixes. I also expect that most players probably won't finish the final boss fight before giving up.
