Zachtronics final game, and what a great one it is. This game is just full of atmosphere and nostalgia. It's somehow fun to have to log into the internet via modem and wait 3 minutes to download a simple game. The little stories that accompany each of them are nostalgic and such a great add. While I was never able to finish any Zachtronics games (they are hard!), I will definitely miss one of the most innovative puzzle game creators in the business. Thanks for the good times!
