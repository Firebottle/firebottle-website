Necrosmith is in a genre I haven't seen in a very long time. It's very much like the old Majesty games, where you create creatures and release them into the wild for them to do their own thing. Your minions then gather monster parts for you that you can use to build your own creatures. This system is a bit shallow, but super fun. It's always great to build a skeleton but give him one super long leg or something. The main goal of the game seems to just be to stay alive as long as possible, but I am unlocking some buildings still that I don't know what they do. Overall, this is a fun (and cheap) game to pick up when there isn't much else out.
