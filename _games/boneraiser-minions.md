Boneraiser Minions is another game in a slew of vampire survivor like games that have come out recently, except this one has a lot of heart. It has a great sense of humor, a fun simplistic art style, and gameplay that will keep you entertained for at least a few hours. Selecting which minions and spells to bring out is always satisfying. My favorite part is that you can choose almost any combination of minions, including all level 1 minions, and you'll still do fine. The only downside is you can unlock almost everything in the game in around 3 hours or so.
