This game is an interesting experience. Originally a mobile game, it has been ported over to PC as a new MMO. Playing this game is sort of like a fever dream. It has everything. Base building anywhere in the open world, pokemon style pet systems, action rpg combat with a large variety of weapons, farming, and more. It's like someone bought a bunch of systems off of the unity store and then pieced them together into a weird amalgamation of game.

Somehow though, it all seems to work. It's a fun weird take on MMOs that is worth checking out. I've easily spent 20+ hours just building and upgrading my house alone. What little adventuring I've done seems interesting, but I need to give it more time.
