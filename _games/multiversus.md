Multiversus is a copy of Super Smash Bros, but with WB characters... and surprisingly it's extremely fun. I've enjoyed all of my time in Multiversus so far. Despite being a free to play game, I've never felt pressured to by currency to unlock anything. If it stays that way, this could be one of the best smash clones on PC. There is just nothing like seeing Velma attack Iron Giant and beat him into a pulp using nothing but her clue hunting skills.
