A wonderful RPG that is entirely built around sound. You can play the entire game with your eyes closed. I love this game because I've never quite seen something like that before. For some reason, listening only to the sound feels more immersive in some ways than having full fledged visuals and everything. But, with that said, the gameplay itself is fairly limited due to this as well.
