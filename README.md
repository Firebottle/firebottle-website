# firebottle-website

### What is this?
This project was built as a personal website for Firebottle. The primary goal is to just get more familiar with typescript, react, next.js, and other popular tools. The secondary goal is to build something that can be used as a personal site for my general purposes.

### Goals
- Move my played games list and ratings from google sheets to this site. It should be searchable, sortable, retain all info, and setup in a way I can easily add to it.
- Create pages for each game mentioned that will pull information from IGDB.com.
- Create a basic blog.
- Create a page to showcase current hardware.
- Create a page to showcase game screenshots
- and more as I come up with ideas.
